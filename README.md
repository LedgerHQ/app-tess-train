# Ledger Tesseract training application

Fork of the boilerplate app used to train the tesseract model for OCR on Nano S Plus and Nano X devices screens.

The goal is not to train Tesseract from scratch but use Nano X (or Nano S Plus) screenshots to fine tune the english model in order to better perform OCR on these screens.

## Training the model

```shell
#Install tesseract
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr

# Pull app-builder docker image and build app for Nano X (same screens as Nano S Plus)
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/ledgerhq/ledger-app-builder/ledger-app-builder-lite:latest
sudo docker run --rm -ti --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --privileged -v "$(realpath .):/app" ghcr.io/ledgerhq/ledger-app-builder/ledger-app-builder-lite:latest bash -c "BOLOS_SDK=/opt/nanox-secure-sdk make"

# Execute the following make target that performs the following actions : 
#     * Prepare language data for tesseract (unichar sets and other training source data) 
#     * Get latest 'best trained' english model
#     * Generate pre-processed training snapshots and then groundtruth data (single line text images + detected text)
#       based on the snapshots.
make prepare-data
```

Now comes the painful step.

For every text line `.tif` image in the ground truth directory (`data/nano-font-ocr-ground-truth`) the detected text in every corresponding `.gt.txt` needs to be **checked** and **manually fixed** so that it is error free when launching the training process.

For instance, take this text line image (let's say it's called `data/nano-font-ocr-ground-truth/00006_processed-002.exp0.tif`)

![example ground truth image](example.png)

Every error has to be fixed in the ground truth text file (that would be `data/nano-font-ocr-ground-truth/00006_processed-002.exp0.gt.txt`)

If the content of the `.gt.txt` is **ECwZar8gIaKjR]Â¥s6G**, it has to be changed so it matches the string of the `.tif`, which in this case is **ECwZarBglaKjRJYs6G**.
### Less painful way

You can use the provided ground truth text that has been prepared in `corrected-ground-truth-text.tar`.

It should be error free if there are no significant changes in the way strings are displayed on the device's screen compared to when this data was prepared.

```shell
# Copy provided ground truth text
make copy-corrected-groundtruth-text
```

If there are no mistakes in the `.gt.txt` files corresponding to the `.tif` training images. You can launch the training :

```shell
# Run training
make train-nano-ocr
```

### Most painful way

If the provided corrected groundtruth text is not matching the generated `.tif` images (for instance if the app screens have significantly changed because of modifications in the SDK or the device OS), you have to manually fix every corresponding `.gt.txt`. Then you can launch the training :

```shell
# Run training
make train-nano-ocr
```
